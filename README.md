# What is this repo about?
This is a limited and naive implementation of the simplex algorithm for polynomial equations. It was meant to help me understand the algorithm beyond the textbook.

I didn't have much knowledge on algorithm and data structure at time (May be still now, but hey! Who is taking notes? :^)
